# Music-Generation-LSTM

We built a sequential model to generate the next musical note given a previous sequence of notes, thus creating a ’new’ song by predicting sequence to follow an existing sequence. We used a bi-directional LSTM model and trained it on genre specific songs available in the MIDI dataset. Kindly open the following notebook on Kaggle to access the datasets used.
